                <p>There are many good reasons to create a blog.</p>
                <p>You may want to practice your writing, create a following, establish your brand or use blogging as a
                    marketing tool to increase site traffic. It’s also a great way to connect with like-minded people.
                </p>
                <p>How do you choose the site to build your blog on?</p>
                <p>There’s a wide choice of blogging platforms. The more choices there are, the harder it is to make up
                    your
                    mind.</p>
                <p>To help you choose the right blogging platform for yourself, we will first talk about what to look
                    for in a
                    blogging solution. After that, we’ll examine the pros and cons of the 10 best blog sites.</p>
                <p>Ready? Let’s get started…</p>
                <h2>How to Choose The Best Blogging Platform</h2>
                <p>For making a decision, it helps to know what you are looking for. As they say – if you don’t know
                    where you
                    are going, every way is the right way. Below are some categories to judge the candidates by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Costs – an indispensable consideration. It’s not only important that your blogging platform of
                        choice
                        fits within your budget but what you also get for your money. A free offer is worth nothing if
                        it
                        doesn’t do what you need.</li>
                    <li>Beginner-friendliness – Beginners need a blogging solution that is easy to set up, manage, and
                        doesn’t
                        need coding skills to run. They also have to be able to find support when they run into trouble.
                    </li>
                    <li>Features and extendability – Over time, your needs and requirements for your site will change.
                        You might
                        want to modify or overhaul the design, add features, or make other drastic changes. A good
                        blogging
                        platform needs to be able to accommodate that.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance – How much hands-on work does your blogging solution need? Does it take care of most
                        of the
                        activities and features for you, or do you have to do everything by hand? This will have a
                        serious
                        impact on your workflow.</li>
                    <li>Monetization options – Many people start a blog or website to eventually earn money with it. If
                        that is
                        your objective as well, you better choose a platform that enables you to do that in a way that
                        works for
                        you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The weighing of the factors above will be different depending on your skills, goals, and
                    requirements. Keep
                    them in mind while we compare the best blogging platforms out there.</p>

                    <p>Among the best blog sites, the self-hosted version of WordPress is, by far the most popular
                        blogging
                        platform in the world. WordPress powers over 30 percent of the Internet. It’s often confused
                        with its
                        close cousin WordPress.com. We will cover the latter as well. You can learn more about the
                        differences
                        between the two platforms in this article.</p>
                    <h3>Pros</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very flexible – WordPress gives you full control over every aspect of your site</li>
                        <li>Highly extendable – you can add almost any functionality through plugins (The <a
                                href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress</a> directory has over 54,000).</li>
                        <li>Thousands of mobile-friendly themes allow you to switch the design of your blog at the touch
                            of a
                            button</li>
                        <li>The platform is search engine friendly and works well with social media</li>
                        <li>You will have full ownership of your content</li>
                        <li>Its large community means lots of support options</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beginner friendly, although running your WordPress website does involve some technical
                            know-how. For
                            that reason, there is a learning curve</li>
                        <li>You are responsible for site maintenance including backups, security, and performance.
                            Fortunately,
                            you can outsource most of that to <a

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Pricing</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is an open-source solution which means it’s free to use. Bear in mind that self-hosted
                        variety
                        requires you to find a hosting provider (e.g., <a

                        can cost you
                        around $50 per year.</p>
                    <p>Also, you might want to spend money on premium plugins and themes that add more flexibility to
                        your blog.

                    <h3>Pricing</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is an open-source solution which means it’s free to use. Bear in mind that self-hosted
                        variety
                        requires you to find a hosting provider (e.g., <a
                            href="https://websitesetup.org/how-to-sign-up-with-bluehost/">Bluehost</a>). You also need
                        to <a href="https://websitesetup.org/how-to-sign-up-with-bluehost/">get your domain</a>. This
                        can cost you
                        around $50 per year.</p>
                    <p>Also, you might want to spend money on premium plugins and themes that add more flexibility to
                        your blog.
