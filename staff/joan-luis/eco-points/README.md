# Project ECO POINTS


## INTRODUCTION

Eco Point is an APP that will allow the user to mark points in areas where they can appreciate the presence of garbage dumped in areas such as rural roads, trails, beaches. For those users who do diving, they can mark that point in the centers. The idea is that those associations or communities that want to take action on those areas have references.

The user can enter the point using the menu option addgarbage. This option will only be valid if a name is entered and an image is attached.


## Functional Description
* Add garbage point: you need to access the websuit and select the menu item add point garbage. A new page will appear and you will be asked to enter your name and     include an image of the discharge. it will only be possible to add a point every 100 meters (Future implementattion)

* Clean garbage point: To indicate that the garbage point has been cleaned, it is necessary to click on the point and a popup will appear that will allow you to        upload an image. The popup will not be displayed unless it is logged in, and in order to log in you will need to register first.
* Register and Login user.
* Show galery images
